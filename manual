git status
git add .
git commit -m "name of patch"
git show HEAD > 0001_.patch

How to launch the Omni build:
Download vendor and device from my git.
Create dirs elephone/p9000 and place them in working_dir/device and in working_dir/vendor
After copy files from downloaded device in working_dir/device , and from downloaded vendor in working_dir/vendor
Open terminal and write:
cd Working_dir
