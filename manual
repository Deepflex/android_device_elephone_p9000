How to make a patches after changes in CM source code:

Cd Working_dir (For example: Cd cm13/frameworks/base)
git status
git add .
git commit -m "name of patch"
git show HEAD > 0001_.patch

How to launch the CM13 build:
Download vendor and device from my git.
Create dirs elephone/p9000 and place them in working_dir/device and in working_dir/vendor
After copy files from downloaded device in working_dir/device , and from downloaded vendor in working_dir/vendor
Open terminal and write:
cd Working_dir
After apply patches:
sh device/elephone/p9000/patches/install.sh
Write:
. build/envsetup.sh && breakfast p9000
mka otapackage p9000
Wait of finish, for me ~2hr
